      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Mili, a sophomore Computer Engineering student.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m interested in creating things that make life easier. Furthermore, I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of free software (free as in freedom) and I&amp;rsquo;m trying to reach my dream of contributing to the free software community.&#xA;I use Arch GNU/Linux as my daily driver and I also use dwm as my window manager. Switching to GNU/Linux has been one of the best decisions I&amp;rsquo;ve ever made.</description>

      <description>Hel Peninsula (Polish: Mierzeja Helska) is a 35-km-long sand bar peninsula in northern Poland separating the Bay of Puck from the open Baltic Sea. The width of the peninsula varies from approximately 300 m near Jurata, through 100 m in the most narrow part to over 3 km at the tip. Since the peninsula was formed entirely of sand, it is frequently turned into an island by winter storms. Until the 17th century the peninsula was a chain of islands that formed a strip of land only during the summer.</description>
