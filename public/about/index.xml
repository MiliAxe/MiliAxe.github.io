      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Mili, a sophomore Computer Engineering student.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m interested in creating things that make life easier. Furthermore, I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of free software (free as in freedom) and I&amp;rsquo;m trying to reach my dream of contributing to the free software community.&#xA;I use Arch GNU/Linux as my daily driver and I also use dwm as my window manager. Switching to GNU/Linux has been one of the best decisions I&amp;rsquo;ve ever made.</description>
