**DISCLAIMER:** This blog post is entirely personal opinions and does not provide
100% psychologically true content.

Egoism has been a topic of importance for me for since I have started following
FOSS. Mainly because of the sharing culture that is present in the community.
In the FOSS community, people share their knowledge, their code, their time and
others help them in return. Nobody is hiding their code or knowledge.

## My bad automatic egoist assumption

Unfortunately, I tend to instantly assume whether someone is an egoist or not based
on the first few interactions. There are some red flags that make me suddenly assume
that the person is an egoist. For example:

- Not being open to criticism
- Rejecting that they are wrong
- Not willing to accept their mistakes
- Craving for attention
- "You wouldn't understand" attitude
- "I am not like others" attitude

**DISCLAIMER:** This is not a good trait and should be avoided. Basically, don't try
this at home. This is basically judging a book by its cover.

## Egoism holds you from improving

I have personally experienced this in a period in my life where I wouldn't listen
to anyone's opinions. Thinking that no matter what, my opinion _is correct_. This
led to numerous wrong beliefs, and some socializing issues.

## Egoism makes you untolerable

At some degree of egoism, you become annoying. Others try to avoid socializing with
you because you tend to gravitate conversations about asserting that you are correct.
Or some individuals tend to constantly try to correct others, which might not be the
best thing when having a conversation.

## Sometimes... It is just copium

From my experience, egoism can be a coping mechanism where individuals might use it to
escape from the fact that they are wrong, and their subconscious use it as a method to
deal with the mental struggles people are having.

## Conclusion

At the end of the day, we are all humans. Humans are completely capable of making
mistakes, and we should not deny it.
