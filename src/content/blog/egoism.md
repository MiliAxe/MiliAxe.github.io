Egoism has been a topic of importance for me for since I have started following
FOSS. Mainly because of the sharing culture that is present in the community.
In the FOSS community, people share their knowledge, their code, their time and
others help them in return. Nobody is hiding their code or knowledge.

## My bad automatic egoist assumption

Unfortunately, I tend to instantly assume whether someone is an egoist or not based
on the first few interactions. There are some red flags that make me suddenly assume
that the person is an egoist. For example:

- Not being open to criticism
- Not accepting that they are wrong
- Not willing to accept their mistakes
- Craving for attention
- "You wouldn't understand" attitude
- "I am not like others" attitude

**DISCLAIMER:** This is not a good trait and should be avoided. Basically, don't try
this at home. This is basically judging a book by its cover.

### 1. Not being open to criticism
