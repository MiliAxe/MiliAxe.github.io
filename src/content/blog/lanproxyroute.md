## Why?

I live in a country with heavy internet censorship. This means that
to access the free internet, everyone in the home network has to turn on some sort
of proxy. This comes with a hefty cost of extra load on any device in our home, whether it
is:

- **Extra stress on mobile batteries**: constantly running VPN profiles on mobile phones make them
  run hotter and significantly impacts their battery life.

- **Poor proxy apps on different platforms**: There is numerous amount of headaches that follow with
  mobile proxy apps. Some don't work properly, some are bloated, some are too heavy on the device.

- **Compatibility**: Some devices like
  Android TVs don't support certain GFW-resistent protocols.

## How it all started

This initially started with me installing Debian on an old PC lying around at the back of my bed.
I was just goofing around, and I wanted to have a working home GNU/Linux server. Debian is great for
servers. It installed gracefully with no headaches and was ready to go in less than 15 minutes. I
always wanted to make the whole process of connecting family members to the free internet easier.

So, here I started my journey of looking for a solution.

## First configuration: clumsy redsocks + iptables setup

If I want to be honest, I initially just asked ChatGPT on what I wanted
to achieve, surprisingly it led me to the right path. I was presented with
a tool called [redsocks](https://darkk.net.ru/redsocks/). My knowledge on
the networking behind this tool is not enough yet, but I am guessing that
it essentially translates the TCP connections made by devices to SOCKS/HTTP
proxy.

This is exactly what I needed. Most of the GFW-resistent proxy protocols usually
run a SOCKS/HTTP proxy on your local machine that you can use it to route your traffic
through it. So you might ask:

### Why don't you just run the SOCKS/HTTP proxy on the machine and call it a day?

Well, there are two reason behind this:

1. I am just too geeky, and sometimes I have to do something for no logical reason.
   (Maybe you can call this OCD too)

2. Most of the devices don't provide a good experience when you set a _SOCKS/HTTP_
   proxy on them for some reason. And some don't even support them _at all_.

3. This would still put extra stress on mobile batteries and moreover, extra hassle
   on the users.

I don't really know 100% what is going behind the curtains in this process, so I
essentially had to try out different combinations of config files to find the working
solution.

Here is the redsocks configuration:

```sh
base {
	// debug: connection progress & client list on SIGUSR1
	log_debug = on;

	// info: start and end of client session
	log_info = on;

	/* possible `log' values are:
	 *   stderr
	 *   "file:/path/to/file"
	 *   syslog:FACILITY  facility is any of "daemon", "local0"..."local7"
	 */
	log = "syslog:daemon";

	// detach from console
	daemon = on;

	/* Change uid, gid and root directory, these options require root
	 * privilegies on startup.
	 * Note, your chroot may requre /etc/localtime if you write log to syslog.
	 * Log is opened before chroot & uid changing.
	 */
	user = redsocks;
	group = redsocks;
	// chroot = "/var/chroot";

	/* possible `redirector' values are:
	 *   iptables   - for Linux
	 *   ipf        - for FreeBSD
	 *   pf         - for OpenBSD
	 *   generic    - some generic redirector that MAY work
	 */
	redirector = iptables;
}

redsocks {
	/* `local_ip' defaults to 127.0.0.1 for security reasons,
	 * use 0.0.0.0 if you want to listen on every interface.
	 * `local_*' are used as port to redirect to.
	 */
	local_ip = 0.0.0.0;
	local_port = 12345;

	// `ip' and `port' are IP and tcp-port of proxy-server
	// You can also use hostname instead of IP, only one (random)
	// address of multihomed host will be used.
	ip = 127.0.0.1;
	port = 2334;


	// known types: socks4, socks5, http-connect, http-relay
	type = socks5;
}

```

This will basically redirect any TCP connection that goes to the port
`12345` on this machine to the SOCKS server `127.0.0.1:2334`. So you will
have to have your proxy server running on `127.0.0.1:2334`.

Now that we have the redsocks configuration, we need to set up the iptables
rules so that the traffic that comes to the machine is redirected to the
redsocks.

```sh
iptables -I INPUT -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -i wls32 -j ACCEPT

iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -d 192.168.0.0/16 -j RETURN
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -d 0.0.0.0/8 -j RETURN

#iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
#iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

#iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp ! --dport 22 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 12345
#iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp ! --dport 22 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 12345
#iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp ! --dport 22 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 10053
#iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p udp ! --dport 22 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 10053

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 12345
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 12345
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 12345
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 12345
iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 6450
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 53 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 6450

#iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -j REDIRECT --to-ports 12345
#iptables -t nat -A OUTPUT -p tcp -j REDIRECT --to-ports 12345
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p tcp -o wls32 -j MASQUERADE
```

This will basically redirect any TCP connection that goes to the port
`80` or `443` to the port `12345` which is the port that redsocks is listening.
Pay attention to the comments in the script, I just wanted to leave them here
to show how I was pulling my hair out while trying to figure out the correct
configuration.

One of the main issues with this setup was that for some reason devices connected
to this machine as a gateway were not able to do DNS queries. I just randomly
tried out routing the DNS queries (port `53`) from the devices to the port `6450` which is
the DNS server that `Hiddify-next` runs. Which

Also, for some reason I had to **specify** the exact port I wanted to redirect and
it wouldn't work if I just redirected all the traffic to the port `12345`.

I would appreciate it if someone could explain to me why this is the case. Don't
hesitate to reach out to me via [email](mailto:miliaxe0@gmail.com).

Lastly I had to specify that the devices use this machine as a gateway. This can
be done by setting the gateway IP to the IP of the machine. You can either specify
the DHCP server to give the IP of the machine as the gateway or you can manually
set the gateway IP on the devices.

Now, this setup was working, but it was not the most elegant solution. Sometimes
this setup would just stop working and I had to restart the machine to make it work
and since I didn't have much knowledge on networking. This didn't satisfy my OCD.

Hereby I present you the second configuration:

## Second configuration: OpenWRT + Passwall

### The issue with the previous configuration

Something that itched my mind the whole time was the problem of routing the traffic.
I wanted to not route the traffic that is domestic to the proxy. My knowledge in routing
via iptables manually was not enough and I had no clue what steps to take.

Another thing that I had in my mind for a long time was to use an [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/) machine
for my home network but my current router did not support it and I had to purchase
a new router for it.

I knew [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/) had an x86 version which you could run on x86 machines but since
I was completely a beginner to [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/), I couldn't really risk it to run it on
bare metal. So I decided to run it on a VM and what's better than QEMU for this
matter?

### Setting up the QEMU VM

QEMU is a free and open-source machine emulator and we can use it to run a VM that runs OpenWRT.
The benefit to this approach is that we can:

1. Access our host even when we have screwed up our OpenWRT install.
2. Dedicate limited amounts of resources.

Another approach might be using other approaches to virtualization like [proxmax](https://www.proxmox.com/en/)

First, I decided to manage my virtual machine using [libvirtd](https://libvirt.org/manpages/libvirtd.html) which is
a convenient open-source daemon to manage different virtual machines.

The QEMU + libvirtd installation procedure should be pretty easy, install the packages
for both QEMU and libvirtd and start the corresponding services.

After this, we can use a fronted for libvirtd called [virt-manager](https://virt-manager.org/). The procedure
now should be pretty easy. We just have to grab the image file from [here](https://firmware-selector.openwrt.org/?version=23.05.3&target=x86%2F64&id=generic)
and go through the wizard in virt-manager and set up our virtual machine.

Before anything, we should make sure that we have set up a bridge so that our VM can talk
with other devices in our network. One thing I have noticed is that the QEMU host should be
connected via LAN to our router to bridge the connection to the guest. I didn't have
much luck setting it up with WLAN connection.

(This section needs to be completed)

## Setting up Passwall

I followed a guide like [this](https://en.faridsguide.com/installing-passwall-and-xray-core-on-openwrt-and-xiaomi-mi-router-4a-gigabit-edition-router/)
to set up Passwall on my OpenWRT machine. Passwall is a great project that simplifies the whole
process of routing the whole network through a proxy. It supports multiple projects like sing-box or Xray
that help hiding your proxy traffic from DPI.

{{< figure align=center src="images/passwallmainpage.png" caption="Passwall's main page" >}}

First off, it is a good idea to download the specified executables or update them if they already exist.
This can be done through the **App Update** where we can download/update the related executables.

To add a new profile, we can go to the **Node list** tab where we can add profiles via link or manually.
In case we want to use different profiles for different domains or IPs, we have to first add their profiles separately.
More on this later.

After adding the profiles, we can simply enable the **Main switch**. And our internet should be tunneled through the
specified proxy. After enabling the switch, The TCP and UDP cards in the main page should turn to a **green text saying**
_running_. I also usually use the **connection** cards to see whether the proxy is working properly.

{{< figure align=center src="images/pingcards.jpg" caption="The tunnel working properly" >}}
![Ping cards](@assets/images/lanproxyroute/pingcards.jpg)

### Using rules to route traffic

One of the good features that this method easily provides is routing traffic based on traffic's domain/IP.
This is mainly done by using a so-called _shunt_. We can specify different profiles and redirect specific
traffic to its corresponding profiles. To make a shunt, we just have to create on in the **Node list**
section. Here, by using the **add** button we can create a profile of type **shunt** (xray and sing-box shunts are supported as of now).

{{< figure align=center src="images/shunt.jpg" caption="A shunt profile" >}}
Here, I have created a sing-box shunt profile where the traffic that matches my DirectGame ruleset don't go through
the proxy. Games that I want to go through proxy AKA ProxyGame go through a specific proxy, and other traffic goes
its specific profile. For example, ChatGPT tends to open up on a slower profile but not on another. Here, we can specify
that the traffic going to OpenAI to be sent to that specific profile. And at the end, if no matching ruleset was found
for the traffic, the traffic goes to the proxy with the lowest latency.

### Specifying rules

In the **Rule Manage** section, we can set which traffic the rule should accept. For example, in the OpenAI rule,
I have set the following:

{{< figure align=center src="images/openairule.jpg" caption="Don't mind spotify here, I was too lazy to create a new rule" >}}

Here, I have specified that this rule accepts the traffic that goes through **_geosite:openai & geosite:spotify_**.
geosite is basically a file that has categories for different types of domains. Some kind man has spent time for us
to easily specify a group of domains by using a single file. Here, I have used the file's OpenAI and Spotify category.
By Specifying this, I don't have to search for every single domain of Spotify, the kind man has done it for me before
in the file.

These files are located under `/usr/share/singbox` for the sing-box profiles.

We can even download other files like this. For example, I have used the great [Iran Hosted Domains](https://github.com/bootmortis/iran-hosted-domains) project to bypass the proxy on domestic traffic. This
greatly helps ping, and it reduces the chances of your proxy getting detected.
the procedure should be as simple ass downloading the latest `iran.dat` file from the releases section
and putting it inside `/usr/share/singbox`. And finally, we can use it in any rule by setting
`ext:iran.dat:all` in the domains section.

## Extra stuff

### DNS Stuff

It is always a good idea to play around with the panel to see which options enhances your connection.
I personally have found it fun to play around with the DNS settings in `Basic Settings > DNS`. You might
want to try different settings there (i.e. UDP, TCP and so on).

### Handy Clear NFTSET button

You might also find it useful at times to use the **Clear NFTSET Button** under the DNS section.
Sometimes it might fix some weird bugs and hiccups.
