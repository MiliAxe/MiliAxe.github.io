One things I have noticed among my university mates is that they don't tend to
understand the value of projects (even mini-projects). What I have noticed is
that they tend to dream of making big projects so much that they forget the
importance of mini-projects.

## They are a prerequisite

Doing mini-projects help you get better in many aspects over time. The truth is,
you can't really just _hop into_ big projects and do them at the first try. Doing
a bunch of mini-projects first helps you get a grasp of a specific programming language.

## Just do them

Mini-projects can be anything that pop up in your mind. Just code anything that
seems fun and cool to you. A few days ago I had this idea of having a handy tool
to get started in journaling. So that was an excuse for me to practice coding rust
and hence, [tsjournal](https://github.com/MiliAxe/tsjournal) was born.

## It can be frustrating

I for one, have been dealing with being scared to start new things for a long time.
Thinking that I am not enough, and I shouldn't even bother doing projects. But
the truth is, just give it a try. Nobody is going to judge you. Don't let the
thoughts in your mind to keep you from being active.

## They can be fun/motivate you

Seeing the projects you do _actually come to life_. Really can give you a boost
in dopamine. They help you keep going and see that you are getting results.
