Have you ever been looking for a specific thing you had in mind and you wanted
to know how to achieve it and you searched the whole _fancy looking websites_ but found
nothing but crap SEO farming content?

_Until..._

You found this beautiful blog that someone wrote that had the same geeky thing in mind
and that blog described the solution to the problem so beautifully that it helped you
find the solution to your problem and saved you a bunch of time?

Or maybe have you ever came across these beautiful blogs that people share their thoughts on?
(usually found on [medium](https://medium.com/) or [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/))

Well, that is what initially inspired me to create a personal website. Maybe I can help out a single
soul on a specific topic. Plus, I think this is way better than sharing content on modern social media.
