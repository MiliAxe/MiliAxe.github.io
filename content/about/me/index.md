I'm _Mili_, a sophomore Computer Engineering student.

I'm interested in creating things
that make life easier. Furthermore, I'm a fan of free software (free as in freedom) and I'm trying to reach
my dream of contributing to the free software community.

I use Arch GNU/Linux as my daily driver and I also use [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) as my window manager.
Switching to GNU/Linux has been one of the best decisions I've ever made. Maybe one day I try out BSDs too.

My interests include:

- Low-level programming
- Clean code and software design
- Free and open-source software
- GNU/Linux and Unix-like operating systems
- Automation that makes life easier
- Anything too nerdy and geeky (probably anti-culture too)

My favorite content creators are:

- [Luke Smith](https://www.youtube.com/@LukeSmithxyz): Luke really helped me to get into the world of free software and GNU/Linux.
- [Mental Outlaw](https://www.youtube.com/@MentalOutlaw): Very nice content about freedom and privacy.
- [Low Level Learning](https://www.youtube.com/@LowLevelLearning): Great content about low-level programming.
